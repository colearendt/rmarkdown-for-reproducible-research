# ABSTRACT

R Markdown is one of many tools available to the R programmer when it comes to
building and sharing the modeling and data pipeline work that has been written
in R. The ability to reliably reproduce results is essential to the success and
impact of a researcherâ€™s work. We will show that R Markdown is a valuable tool
for this task by introducing R Markdown, showing a handful of examples, and
discussing best practices. When all prose, reporting, and output is generated by
a single file based on data inputs, the researcher is freed from semantics and
can enjoy truly data-driven results.
