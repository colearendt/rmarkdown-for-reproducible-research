# ABSTRACT

R Markdown is one of many tools available to the R programmer when it comes to
building and sharing the modeling and data pipeline work that has been written
in R. The ability to reliably reproduce results is essential to the success and
impact of a researcherâ€™s work. We will show that R Markdown is a valuable tool
for this task by introducing R Markdown, showing a handful of examples, and
discussing best practices. When all prose, reporting, and output is generated by
a single file based on data inputs, the researcher is freed from semantics and
can enjoy truly data-driven results.

# INTRODUCTION

The researcher's task is to uncover new things; challenge conventional wisdom;
explore uncharted territory; and confirm or dismiss bias with facts. In order to
accomplish such feats, it is important that a researcher's results be
_reproducible,_ that is:

> Results are reproducible if they can be reliably replicated or recomputed in
another time or place.

For a researcher that is trying to have an impact that extends beyond the "here and now,"
reproducible results ensure that conclusions are valid in another time and place. Further,
for industries like the Pharmaceutical Industry, reproducibility can be a mandate and 
legal requirement for valid results. As a result, tools like R Markdown that help ensure
reproducible results are valuable tools in a researcher's toolkit.

# GETTING STARTED

## WHAT IS MARKDOWN?

The story of R Markdown begins with Markdown, a markup language and formatting
syntax designed to be:

 - human readable
 - flexible in its output

For example, where HTML would allow writing bold and italicized text like:

```
This is <b>bold</b> and <i>italicized</i> text
```

Markdown allows bold and italicized text with:

```
This is **bold** and _italicizied_ text
```

A subtle difference, but Markdown is more readable because there are not any
letters injected, and it is _much faster_ to type. It also has more simplicity
in its objectives and flexibility in its output, so where HTML is rendered
almost exclusively in browsers, Markdown can be relevant for the web, print, and
even computer terminals.

## WHAT IS R MARKDOWN?

If Markdown is a lightweight markup language and text formatting syntax, R Markdown
must be Markdown + R code, right? Yes, with a catch. R Markdown actually supports
_many_ programming languages and output types. It got its start with R, and R is
the primary language engine, but R is an interface language. This means that R
is commonly used to "wrap" or
